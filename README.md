- Supports full [Page Management](https://agilitycms.com/docs/overview/page-management)

### Tailwind CSS

This starter uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a simple and lightweight utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

It also comes equipped with [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer), a plugin which use the data based on current browser popularity and property support to apply CSS prefixes for you.

This project is using Node.js to generate the tailwind css classes.

## Getting Started

ðŸš¨ Before you dive into the code, it's important that you have the latest version of the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine (>=v8.0), as the project will _not_ run without this.

### Setting up the Starter

1. cd into the `Agility.NET.Starter` directory.
2. Rename the `appsetting.json.example` file to `appsettings.json`.
3. Overwrite the values in the `appsettings.json` file with the credentials from the API Keys page in [Agility Settings](https://app.agilitycms.com/settings/apikeys).

## Running the Site Locally

- `dotnet build` => Builds the website
- `dotnet run` => Builds & runs the website
- `npm run dev & dotnet watch` => Builds and runs the site in Watch mode, so changes are reflected in the browser immediately.
- `dotnet clean` => Cleans the build outputs of the site
